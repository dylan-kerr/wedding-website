# Wedding Website #

An archived, static copy of my wedding website.

The original site was a Knockout frontend app which communicated with a Node/Express backend and a MongoDB database, hosted in Heroku. Prompted by the impending termination of the database (the result of an acquisition of the company providing that Heroku add-on), I removed all of the dynamic parts of the site and converted it to the most static, plain code possible with the hope that it will stay functional for as long as possible.
