                                Both the ceremony and reception will be held in Location. Location is less than three hours drive south of City, so we hope you will be able to drive down on the morning of the date rather than needing to travel the night before.
                                <hr />
                                The ceremony will begin at Venue at 1.30pm on the main lawn. After the ceremony, we would love to get a group photo with everyone, so please donâ€™t disappear straight away! You are welcome to stay at Venue for tea and games, or even to walk the labyrinth yourselves!
                                <br /><br />
                                The reception will be held at the Venue, beginning at 5pm and continuing until around 11pm.

                                It should be possible to return to City on Saturday night after joining us for dinner, but if you would like to stay later in the evening or drink there is a variety of great accommodation in and around Location - we recommend you book early in case it fills up.
                                <br /><br />
                                The Accommodation is now available on Friday and Saturday nights.

                                We have organised a couple of small buses to help you get between Venue, the Venue and your accommodation. One of these can collect you from your accommodation in Location and take you to Venue in time for our Labyrinth walk at 1.30pm. The bus will then be available to shuttle people between Venue and the Venue in time for the reception at 5pm. At the end of the evening, we have arranged for a couple of runs back to your accommodation from the Venue departing at 10pm and 11pm.
                                <br /><br />
                                If you are staying in Location or the very near surrounds and would like to make use of this service please let us know the name and address of your accommodation, how many people would like a seat and your preferred return time to accommodation using the RSVP form. We will confirm your spot on a bus and approximately what time you will be collected from your accommodation as soon as we can.
                                <br /><br />
                                There is some parking at the Venue and it will be possible to park there and use the shuttle to get to Venue. It is about a 1km walk for those wishing to get some exercise!

                                The caterers are able to accommodate dietary requirements and there will be vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free options. If you have any further dietary restrictions, please let us know when you RSVP.

                                We would love to begin our reception with some traditional dances. We have chosen simple dances and weâ€™d love you to have a go and join in with us! The steps are below. We plan to hold a pre-wedding dance party if you'd like to practise with us!
                                <br /><br />
                                More 'normal' music and dancing will follow and carry on into the evening.

                            <p>These are the dances we'd like you to join us for. They are mostly traditional French or Breton dances and are easy to learn and fun to dance! Alana will be teaching these on the night but it will be helpful to have a look over these written instructions as well.</p>

                                                    A slightly tricky step which results in everyone changing partners. Raise arms to make an arch. The lady/person currently on the inside goes under the arch and travels backwards to meet their new partner, turning as they go to end up on the outside and facing anti-clockwise to begin the dance again. The man/person who started this step on the outside stays in the same space, although moving a little to the left to make room for their new partner.

                                It will be kind of like a wedding - but only kind of.
                                <br /><br />
                                We wanted a ceremony that felt comfortable and personal. This will take the form of a hand-fasting style ceremony preceded by a meditative labyrinth walk with music that is special to us.
                                <br /><br />
                                While the wedding does not have a specific theme, we have designed it to reflect our interests and passions. If youâ€™d like ideas for what to wear or are wondering about the general feel of the wedding, think foresty, elven and slightly inspired by the medieval. (And if youâ€™re still stuck for things to wear, just pick something that makes you happy!)
                                <br /><br />
                                The reception will be a kaleidoscope of music that we like, with food, drink and dancing for those inclined.
